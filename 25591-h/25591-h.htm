<hr class="full" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg 381]</span></p>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>A Swedish scientist has invented a new building material called
sylvenselosit. It is said to cost one-fifth the price of the building
material in use in this country, which is known to the trade as
wishyumagetit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A folding motor-car is said to have been invented which has a greater
speed than any other car. The next thing that requires inventing is a
folding pedestrian to cope with it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Berlin manufacturers are experimenting in making clothing from nettles.
This is a chance that the nettle has long been waiting for.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A business magazine suggests that a series of afternoon chats with
business men should be arranged. Our war experience of morning back
chats at the grocer&#8217;s is not encouraging.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The capture of General <span class="sc">Carranza</span>, says a Vera Cruz message, was a mistake
on the part of General <span class="sc">Sanchez</span>. We trust this does not mean that they
will have to start the thing all over again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Those who understand the Mexican trouble say it is doubtful whether
America can deal with this war until the Presidential election is over.
One war at a time is the American motto.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We gather from a contemporary that people who have been ordering large
stocks of coal in the hope of escaping the new prices will be
disappointed. Still, they may get in ahead of the next advance.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The inventor of the silent typewriter is now in London. We seem to know
the telephone which gave him the idea.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A man at Bow Street Court complained that the Black Maria which conveyed
him there was very stuffy. Some prisoners say that this vehicle is so
unhealthy as to drive custom away from the Court.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Fruit blight threatens to be serious this year, says a daily paper, and
drastic action should be taken against the apple weevil. A very good
plan is to make an imitation apple of iron and then watch the weevil
snap at it and break off its teeth.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>One North of England workman is said to be in a bit of a hole. It seems
that he has mislaid his strike-fixture card.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Immediately after a football match at Londonderry, one of the players
was shot in the leg by an opponent. The latter claims that he never
heard the whistle blow.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Dr. <span class="sc">Eugene Fisk</span>, President of the Life Extension Institute, promises by
scientific means to prolong human life for nineteen hundred years. If
this is the doctor&#8217;s idea of a promise we would rather not know what he
would call a threat.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Wood for making pianos, says a weekly journal, is often kept for forty
years. &ldquo;And even this,&rdquo; writes &ldquo;Jaded Parent,&rdquo; &ldquo;is not half long
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>With reference to the man who was seen laughing at Newport last week, it
is only fair to point out that he was not a ratepayer, but was only
visiting the place.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Larry Lemon</span>, says <i>The Sunday Express</i>, is considered to be better than
<span class="sc">Charlie Chaplin</span>. As he is quite a young man, however, it is possible
that he may yet grow out of it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Clerk of the oldest City Company writes to <i>The Times</i> to say that
his Livery has resolved to drink no champagne at its feasts. Meanwhile
other predictions as to the end of the world should be treated with
reserve.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>After the statement in court by Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Darling</span> people contemplating
marriage should book early for divorce if they want to avoid the rush.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>&ldquo;Why Marry?&rdquo; says the title of a new play. While no valid reason appears
to exist many declare that it is a small price to pay for the
satisfaction of being divorced.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Three-fourths of the public only buy newspapers to read the
advertisements, says a contemporary. It would be interesting to know
what the others buy them for.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>&ldquo;Few people seem to realise,&rdquo; says a cinema gossip, &ldquo;that Miss S. Eaden,
the American film actress, is fond of tulips.&rdquo; We are ashamed to confess
that we had not fully grasped this fact.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It appears that one newspaper has decided that May 24th shall be the
opening date for ceasing to notice the cuckoo. Will correspondents
please note?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>&ldquo;Things are unsettled in Ireland,&rdquo; says a gossip writer. We think people
should be more careful what they say. Scandal like this might get about.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A certain golf club has petitioned the local Council for permission to
play golf &ldquo;in a modified form.&rdquo; Members who recently heard the Club
Colonel playing out of the bunker at the seventh declare that no
substantial modification is possible.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A new invention for motorists makes a buzzing sound when the petrol tank
is getting low. This is nothing compared with the motor-taxes invented
by the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>, which make the motorist himself
whistle.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the opinion of a weekly paper no dog can stand the sound of bagpipes
without setting up a howl. This only goes to prove, what we have always
contended, that dogs are almost human.</p>

<h2>A LIAR&#8217;S MASTERPIECE.</h2>

<p>My friend Arthur&#8217;s hobby is the stupendous. He conceives himself to be
the direct successor of the mediæval travel-story merchants. War-tales,
of course, are barred to him, for nothing is too improbable to have
happened during the War, and all the best lies were used by
professionals while Arthur was still serving. Once, however, in his
career he has realised his ambition to be taken for a perfect liar, and
that time he happened to be speaking the simple truth. I was his referee
and he did it in this wise.</p>

<p>When <span class="sc">Allenby</span> was making his last great drive against the Turk, he was no
doubt happy in the knowledge that Arthur and I were pushing East through
Bulgaria to take his adversary in the rear. We pushed with speed and
address, but just when it looked as if we should exchange the tactical
for the practical we stopped and rusticated at the hamlet of
Skeetablista, on the Turco-Bulgarian frontier.</p>

<p>Skeetablista was under the control of Marko and Stefan and an assorted
following of Bulgar cut-throats. Although the mutual hatchet had been
interred a bare three weeks we found ourselves among friends. Thomas
Atkins was soon talking Bulgarian with ease and fluency, while his
&ldquo;so-called superiors,&rdquo; as the company Bolshevik put it, celebrated the
occasion by an international dinner in Marko&#8217;s quarters. The dinner
consisted chiefly of rum (provided by us) and red pepper (provided by
Marco and Stefan).</p>

<p>These latter were bright and eager youths from Sofia military academy,
and while the rum and red pepper passed gaily round they talked the shop
of their Bulgarian Sandhurst in a queer mixture of English and French.
They made living figures for us of the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>, who had inspected them
not long before, of <span class="sc">Ferdie</span> and of <span class="sc">Boris</span> his son, and told moving tales
of British gunfire from the wrong end. We countered with <span class="sc">Kitchener</span>,
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> and the British Navy, while outside in the night the
Thracian wolves howled derisively at both alike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like plenty to travel away and see the other countries,&rdquo; said
Marko, rolling us cigarettes after dinner. &ldquo;This is a good country, but
<i>ennuyant</i>. &#8217;Ow the wolfs make plenty <i>brouhaha</i> to-night, <i>hein?</i>
Stefan, did you command the guard to conduct our frien&#8217;s &#8217;ome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stefan waggled his head from side to side in assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Marko, &ldquo;to see Italie, Paris, Londres. Particulierly
Londres.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live in London,&rdquo; Arthur remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You live?&rdquo; said Marko with interest. &ldquo;Tell me, &#8217;ow great is Londres?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How great?&rdquo; repeated Arthur, doubtful what kind of greatness was
indicated, moral or material.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, &#8217;ow great? From one side to the other side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; replied Arthur, and took thought. &ldquo;About twenty-five
kilometres, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five!&rdquo; Marko&#8217;s eyes rounded with astonishment. &ldquo;<i>Écoute, Stefan;
vingt-cinq kilomètres.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; demanded Stefan, &ldquo;&#8217;ow many people is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About six millions,&rdquo; replied Arthur, swelling with pleasure. At last he
had found his incredulous audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is a nation! I do not know if there are so many in all
Bulgarie,&rdquo; cried Marko. &ldquo;&#8217;Ow do they travel? No droski could go so
far&mdash;it is a day&#8217;s march. But perhaps you &#8217;ave tramway? In Sofia we &#8217;ave
tramway,&rdquo; he added, not without pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are trams, but most of the people travel in buses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bussesse?&rdquo; interjected Stefan. &ldquo;<i>Qu&#8217; est-ce que c&#8217;est</i>, bussesse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lorries&mdash;<i>camions</i>. Big automobiles containing many people. And there
are also underground railways, railways under the ground in a tunnel.
You know tunnels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui, galleria.</i> But a railway under a town&mdash;<i>mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said Marko,
appalled. &ldquo;&#8217;Ow do the people descend to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In lifts&mdash;<i>ascenseurs</i>. From the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stefan nodded assent. &ldquo;I &#8217;ave seen <i>ascenseurs</i> at Sofia,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In these tunnels,&rdquo; continued Arthur, visibly warming to his work,
&ldquo;trains go to all parts of the town every three minutes, and the cost is
only twenty <i>statinki</i>. The streets above are paved with wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With <i>wood! Kolossal!</i>&rdquo; said Marko, forgetting our prejudice against
Bosch idiom in his wonder at this crowning marvel.</p>

<p>To what lengths of veracity Arthur would have gone I never knew, for at
that moment a trampling of feet and a hoarse command outside announced
the arrival of our escort, and Marko, still in a sort of walking swoon
of amazement, went out to give them their orders.</p>

<p>Stefan regarded us with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>farceur!</i>&rdquo; he remarked, shaking his finger waggishly at Arthur. &ldquo;I
know all the time you make the joke, but poor Marko, you &#8217;ave deceived
&#8217;im <i>absolument</i>. Railway under the ground, streets of wood, &#8217;e swallow
it all. Oh, naughty <i>Baroutchik!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolves did not come near us and our escort on our way home, but they
could have had Arthur for the taking. At the moment he had nothing left
to live for.</p>

<h2>THE PERSONAL TOUCH.</h2>

<p>(<i>By our tireless Political Penetrator.</i>)</p>

<p>For some time past, I understand, the Government has been considering
steps to bring the personalities of Cabinet Ministers more prominently
into the public eye. &ldquo;We are not sufficiently known,&rdquo; said Sir <span class="sc">William
Sutherland</span>, who has the matter in hand, &ldquo;as living palpitating figures
to the man in the street. We do not grip the nation&#8217;s heart. We lack
pep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him that it was a pity about pep. I felt that the Government
ought to have pep. and plenty of it. If possible they ought to have
vineg. and must. too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Occasional paragraphs in the Press, snapshots
which take us very likely with one leg stuck out in front as if we were
doing the goose-step, rare provincial excursions and bouquets from
admiring mill-girls are all very well in their way, but they are nothing
to constant personal appearances at stated times and in stated places
before an admiring mob. The heroes of sport are overshadowing us,&rdquo; he
continued with a sigh, pushing me over a box of cigars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo; I asked, lighting one and putting
another carefully behind my ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must remember first,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that this is quite a modern
difficulty. Statesmen of the past used to make their leisurely progress
through the town surrounded by retainers on horseback, or in
sedan-chairs, beautifully dressed and scattering largesse as they went.
<span class="sc">Thomas à Becket</span>, the great Primate and Chancellor, used to have poor men
to dine with him and crowds thronging round to bless him. To-day, I
suppose, <span class="sc">Joe Beckett</span> in his flowered dressing-gown would be a more
popular figure than Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span> and the Archbishop of <span class="sc">Canterbury</span>, if
you can imagine them rolled into one. In <span class="sc">Charles</span> II.&#8217;s reign, when
politicians used to play <i>pêle-mêle</i> where the great Clubs are now,
anyone could rub shoulders with my lord of <span class="sc">Buckingham</span> and, if he was
lucky, get a swipe across the shins with the ducal mallet itself. That
is the kind of thing we want now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had thoughts of running popular excursions down to Walton Heath, but
I am not sure that the people would care to go so far even to see Sir
<span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span> carrying the home green and Lord <span class="sc">Riddell</span>&mdash;the Riddell of the
sands, as we call him affectionately down there&mdash;getting out of a
difficult bunker. So I am trying to arrange for a few putting greens in
railed-off spaces in St. James&#8217;s Park near the pelicans, and we also
propose to hold there on fine summer days the breakfast parties for
which the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> is so famous. We shall make a point of throwing
not only crumbs to the birds, but slices of bread and marmalade to the
more indigent spectators. We shall also try to get two or three open
squash racket courts in Whitehall, so that on hot summer days the most
carping critic who watches a rally between Mr. <span class="sc">Austen Chamberlain</span> and
the <span class="sc">Secretary of State</span> for <span class="sc">War</span> will have to admit that we are doing our
utmost to eliminate waste-products.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about the clothes and the stately progress and the largesse?&rdquo;
I asked; the largesse idea had struck me with particular force.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[pg 385]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are thinking of goat carriages and overalls for economy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and the largesse cannot, I am afraid, be allowed for in the Treasury
Estimates. But we shall certainly scatter a handful or two of O.B.E.&#8217;s
as we go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how will you deal with the country and the outer suburbs?&rdquo; I asked
when my admiration had partially subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there you have the Cinema,&rdquo; replied Sir <span class="sc">William</span> enthusiastically.
&ldquo;We are going to make great strides with the Cinema. Our first film,
which is now in preparation, deals with the Leamington episode and has
been very carefully staged. It has been necessary, of course, in the
interests of art to elaborate the actual incidents to a certain extent.
Coalition Liberals, for instance, were obliged to board the train in the
traditional manner of the screen, leaping on to it whilst in motion and
climbing, some by way of the brakes and buffers, some along the roofs of
the carriages, into their reserved compartment. Then again we could not
reassemble the actual gathering of Wee Frees to represent the enemy, but
we secured the services of actors well trained in Wild West and &ldquo;crook&rdquo;
parts, capably led by those two prominent comedians, <i>Mr. Mutt</i> and <i>Mr.
Jeff</i>. The film ends, of course, with the second meeting at the Central
Hall, Westminster, when <i>Messrs. Mutt</i> and <i>Jeff</i> again appear as comic
and objectionable interrupters, and are ignominiously hurled into the
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very soon we hope to have all important Parliamentary debates filmed.
It will be essential, of course, to provide some comic relief, and we
are relying confidently on certain Members to practise the wearing of
mobile moustaches and to take lessons in the stagger, the butter slide,
the business with the cane and the quick reversal of the hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In short you think politics should be more spectacular?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<span class="sc">Hobbs</span> the mammoth hitter and a little less of the
<i>Leviathan</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Greatly impressed I bit off the end of his second cigar and went back to
the office to look up <i>Leviathan</i>.</p>

<h2>AURAL TUITION.</h2>

<p>The only other occupant of the carriage was a well dressed man of middle
age, clad in English clothes, but from many slight signs palpably a
foreigner of some sort.</p>

<p>Soon after the train started I noticed that his mouth and throat were
twitching and I surmised that he was about to speak. But speech is no
term in which to describe the queer animal, vegetable and mineral sounds
which issued from him. First his mouth opened slightly and he seemed
about to sneeze. Next I was conscious of a scraping noise in his throat,
accompanied by a slight ticking. It appeared that he was going to have a
fit and I regretted that we were alone. The noise grew louder, took on
speed and rose in a crescendo almost to a screech. Then a few more
scrapes, as of a pencil on a slate, and I began to detect that he was
speaking. His lips did not move, so that his voice had a curiously
distant sound. Nevertheless the words were clearly audible.</p>

<p>The following is what he said in a low, metallic monotone: &ldquo;Good
morning, Sir. I am very pleased to meet you. Can you tell me what
o&#8217;clock it is? I am much obliged. I wish to descend at Manchester. At
what hour do we arrive there? There are few passengers to-day. The
weather is fine. I beg your pardon if I do not make myself clear. I do
not speak English perfectly as yet. No doubt I have need of much
practice. Can I send a telegram from the next station? Is there a good
hotel at Manchester? Will you do me the favour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; I cried, after having several times opened my mouth to answer
one or other of his questions.</p>

<p>As soon as I spoke the words ended with a sudden click; the voice
descended and became a scrape; at last silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall be happy to give you any information I
can if you will ask one question at a time. You evidently speak English
very well indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face lighted with approval of the compliment and then the whole
performance began over again. Once more the wheeze, the scrape, the
screech, the tick and all the rest of it. I became terrified at these
painful impediments in his speech.</p>

<p>I remembered that somebody had once told me what to do on such
occasions. It was either to throw the patient upon his back and move his
arms up and down in a travesty of rowing or to slap him violently on the
back. Seeing that the stranger was several times larger than myself I
chose with diffidence the latter course. Rising to my feet I turned him
round and thumped his back vigorously. He received the treatment with
amiable smiles. Next he produced from his pocket a booklet, which he
handed to me with a polite bow, desisting entirely from his menagerie
noises.</p>

<p>I am of a nervous temperament and needed some minutes&#8217; rest in which to
collect myself. Then I began to examine the stranger&#8217;s gift.</p>

<p>It was a well-printed pamphlet, obviously an advertisement:&mdash;</p>

language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lower down I saw: &ldquo;Contents of Records. No. 1, At the Hotel; No. 2, At
the Railway Station; No. 3, In the Train.&rdquo; Ah! there it was&mdash;the whole
monologue:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Sir. I am very pleased to meet you. Can you tell me&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The explanation relieved me; I turned to my fellow-traveller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I congratulate you on being the perfect pupil.
Your teacher, could it feel such emotions, would be proud of you. Only
to an exceptional student can it be given so faithfully to reproduce
&lsquo;His Master&#8217;s Voice.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE MAKING OF A CRISIS.</h2>

<blockquote><p>[We are privileged to-day to publish an unwritten chapter from Mr. <span class="sc">H. G.
Wells&#8217;</span> <i>History of the World</i>. It is entitled &ldquo;The Slime Age,&rdquo; and has a
topical interest since it outlines the methods of production of the
Crisis, the only article of which the supply to-day exceeds the demand.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Out of all this muddle and confusion and slipshod thinking there arose
one man with a purpose, one man who fixed his eyes on a single
inevitable goal and walked straight at it, not minding what or whom he
trod upon on the way. His purpose was the mass-production of crises, and
he created crises as rabbits create their young, nine at a time. In
those fuddled incompetent days before the Great War the crisis was a
little-known phenomenon. Here and there in the drab routine of peaceful
corpulent years there flashed in the prosperous firmament the baleful
light of a great anxiety. Agadir was one; <span class="sc">Carson</span> and his gun-runners was
another. But they were few; they came like rare comets and were
forgotten.</p>

<p>Then in the Great War a new habit was born in the minds of the people,
the habit of crises. Even then at first they came decently, in ordered
succession&mdash;Mons, Ypres, the Coalition, Gallipoli. But the people&#8217;s
craving was insatiable; the people cried for more crises.</p>

<p>Then this man stood up and said to the people, &ldquo;I will give you crises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he did. Instead of a casual crisis here and there, to every year a
crisis or two, he gave them a crisis every month, every week, every day,
and still they were not satisfied. And so, at last, out of all the
muddle and waste and pettifogging stupidity this man created crises as
men create matches, by the gross. And this was how he created them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="slime"><i>Extract from &ldquo;The Slime,&rdquo; April 3rd, a paragraph in the Foreign

<p class="slimeright">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Bobadig</span>, <i>April 1st.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A party of French mules, passing to their quarters in the vilayet of
Arimabug, were to-day attacked by an Australian sheep on the staff of
the British Military Mission. It is feared that many of the mules were
injured. Feeling runs high among the peasantry, incensed already by the
failure of the British Government to provide mosquito-nets for the
sacred goats.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slime"><i>Extract from a leading article in &ldquo;The Slime,&rdquo; April 6th, on Land

<p>&ldquo; ... Parliament to-day will be occupied with the preposterous Budget

Minister</span> for an explanation of the outrageous incident at Bobadig
reported in our columns last week. There is only too good reason to fear
that the policy of alternate violence and inertia, against which we have
so often protested, has at last inflamed the law-abiding animals of
Bobadig ...&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slime"><i>From &ldquo;The Slime&rdquo; Special Correspondent:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="slimeright">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Bobadig</span>, <i>April 8th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Since my last message (much mutilated by the Censor) events have moved
rapidly. Two of the mules have died of their injuries in hospital; three
others lie in a dangerous condition at Umwidi, four miles away, where
they fled for refuge from the wanton onslaught of the Australian sheep.
This sheep, it now transpires, was the personal attendant of General
Riddlecombe, Head of the Military Mission, a circumstance which is not
calculated to allay the local animosity which the incident has aroused.
The situation will require all the tact that the British Government can
command.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slime"><i>Extract from the Special Crisis Column of &ldquo;The Slime,&rdquo; April 11th:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="slime">&ldquo;ANGLO-ARMENIAN RELATIONS.<br />GRAVE WARNING.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a telegram which we print in another column our Special
Correspondent in Armenia confirms to-day the serious fears to which we
gave expression in our issue of April 6th concerning the possibility of
a crisis in Anglo-Armenian relations. The incident of the Bobadig mules
is already bearing fruit, and we can no longer doubt that popular
feeling in the vilayet of Arimabug has been dangerously inflamed by the
obtuse procrastination of the British Government. These unfortunate
mules....&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slimeright">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Scratchipol</span>, <i>April 10th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Communications with Bobadig have broken down, but it is reported that a
mule was buried there on Sunday in circumstances of great popular
excitement. A large crowd followed the body to the cemetery and made a
demonstration after the ceremony outside the house of the local
veterinary surgeon, who is alleged to have treated the animal for mumps
instead of sheep-shock, with fatal results.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slime"><i>From &ldquo;The Slime,&rdquo; April 14th:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="slime">&ldquo;GRAVE CRISIS.<br />ARMENIAN ANGER.<br />THE MURDERED MULES.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we feared, a serious crisis has arisen in Anglo-Armenian relations.
At Bobadig a third mule has perished and his interment was made the
occasion of a great popular demonstration against the policy of Great
Britain. In diplomatic circles no one is attempting to conceal that the
situation is extremely grave. The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> has returned to Downing
Street from Le Touquet. Shortly after his arrival the Armenian Minister
drove up in a motor-cab and was closeted with the <span class="sc">Premier</span> for a full ten
minutes. After lunch, Lord Wurzel arrived in his brougham. At tea-time
the Minister of Mutton-Control dashed up in a 24 &#8217;bus, followed rapidly
by the Secretary of State for War on his scooter. Mr. Burble wore an
anxious look....&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slime"><i>Extract from a leading article in &ldquo;The Slime,&rdquo; April 16th:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="slime">&ldquo;SPIT IT OUT.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We trust it is not already too late to appeal to the Government to
extricate the Empire from the perilous position in which their wilful
stupidity has placed it. The news from Bobadig is exceedingly serious.
Another of the affronted mules has perished in circumstances of the
foulest indignity; it only remains for the other two to die for the
triumph of British statesmanship to be complete. These wretched
creatures are being slowly sacrificed for the foolish whim of a British
Prime Minister. No doubt remains that they have been subjected to
sheep-shock by the savage bites of the Australian animal. The
Government, blinded by its own infatuate folly and deaf to the
storms of popular indignation in this country, continues to treat them
for mumps.... By this test the Government will be judged at the
forthcoming election. They must realise that the time for trifling is
past. If the resources of the British Empire are unable at this date to
combat the menace of sheep-shock among the loyal mules of Bobadig, then
indeed.... At least we are entitled to ask for an explanation of the
presence of an infuriated sheep on the staff of a British General. The
PRIME MINISTER....&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slime"><i>From &ldquo;The Slime,&rdquo; April 17th:&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="slime">&ldquo;AT LAST.</p>

<p>The situation in Bobadig is easing rapidly. The Government has at last
carried out the instructions of <i>The Slime</i>, and we understand that a
Ministerial expert in sheep-shock has been sent to the assistance of the
surviving mules. But while we may congratulate ourselves on the lifting
of the clouds in that direction matters in West Ham give ground for the
gravest anxiety. The wood-lice of West Ham are proverbially of an
irritable nature, and the attitude of the Government has been calculated
for some time to inflame....&rdquo;</p>

<h2>COMMUNISM AT CAMBRIDGE.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
[Bolshevism and Communism claim many adherents among the young
intellectuals at our ancient Universities.&mdash;<i>Vide Press.</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>I am a Socialist, a Syndicalist, an Anarchist, a Bolshevist&mdash;whatever
you like to call me; if you wish to be precise, an International
Communist.</p>

<p>Anyhow, as such I am opposed tooth-and-nail to the iniquity of the
existing Competitive System. It is my intention to devote my life to its
eradication, in whatever form it may be disguised, and to inaugurate an
era of loving-kindness, peace, leisure and plenty, similar to that now
enjoyed by the people of Russia.</p>

<p>But my duties do not lie only in the distant future; they are here, in
the present, facing me in the University. For never, I think, was the
unclean thing, Competition, so prevalent and unabashed as at Cambridge
to-day.</p>

<p>Both in work and in sport is the evil rampant. Take as an example the
reactionary custom of dividing the Tripos Honours List into three
classes. Can you imagine anything more inducive to competition? Worse,
it is a direct invitation to the worker&mdash;often, I am proud to say,
unheeded&mdash;to exceed the one-hour-day for which we Communists are
striving.</p>

<p>Even more deplorable is the competitive spirit in sport; more deplorable
because more insidious. Even those whom we are wont to regard as our
comrades and leaders are not always proof against the canker in this
guise. I remember paying a visit to Fenner&#8217;s, that fair field corrupted
by competition, to raise my protest against inter-collegiate sports. To
my indescribable grief and amazement I beheld one whom I had always
followed and reverenced&mdash;a man of mighty voice oft lifted in
debate&mdash;preparing to <i>compete</i> (mark the word) in a Three-Mile Race.
&ldquo;Stay, comrade,&rdquo; I cried. He heeded me not; moreover, it certainly
appeared to me that he attempted&mdash;thank God, unsuccessfully&mdash;to win the
race. Maybe I go too far in ascribing to him this desire to come in
first, with a resultant triumph over his fellows; but was not his very
entrance a countenancing of evil? Had he considered the feelings of
bitter enmity inspired in the many who toiled behind him? And the
encouragement to College rivalry!&mdash;a rivalry in no way differing from
that between nations, save that College distinctions are, of course,
less artificial.</p>

<p>It becomes obvious, I think, to every unprejudiced observer that most of
the games now unfortunately so popular at the University&mdash;rowing,
cricket, football and the like&mdash;<i>must go</i>. But let it not be assumed
that the Communist is averse from recreation properly conducted; far
from it. There is no possible objection to diabolo or top-spinning, for
instance, and, though competitive marbles must not be played (whether on
the Senate House steps or elsewhere), solitaire may be permitted as in
no way provoking the deplorable spirit of rivalry.</p>

<p>Of other games the Communist will discard bridge, billiards and &ldquo;general
post&rdquo;; and even &ldquo;hunt-the-slipper&rdquo; and &ldquo;hide-and-seek&rdquo; are not
altogether free from the competitive taint. But an excellent game is
open to him in &ldquo;patience,&rdquo; while there is no pastime more indicative of
the true Communistic spirit than &ldquo;ring-a-ring o&#8217; roses,&rdquo; so long as
proper care be taken that at the last &ldquo;tishu&rdquo; all the players collapse
simultaneously.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p><i>Monday, May 10th.</i>&mdash;But for the presence of a handful of Irish Peers
and of Sir <span class="sc">Edward Clarke</span> (looking little older than when he pulverised
<span class="sc">Gladstone&#8217;s</span> second Home Rule scheme in 1893) you would never have
thought that this was the first day in Committee of the Bill &ldquo;for the

settlement, coupled with the Ulster leader&#8217;s promise that, much as he
loathed the idea of a separate Parliament, he would work it for all he
was worth, carried the day. Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith&#8217;s</span> Amendment was knocked out by
259 to 55.</p>

<p>In subsequent Amendments other Members attempted to emphasise the idea
of ultimate union by calling the statutory bodies &ldquo;Councils&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;Parliaments,&rdquo; and by setting up a single Senate to control them both.
But they did not meet with acceptance. Captain <span class="sc">Elliott</span> thought the first
as absurd as the idea that you could make two dogs agree by chaining
them together, and Mr. <span class="sc">Long</span> dismissed the second with the remark (which
shows how rapidly his political education has advanced since the
Parliament Act) that he was in great doubt as to whether a Second
Chamber was in itself a protection for minorities.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 11th.</i>&mdash;Lord <span class="sc">Londonderry</span> moved the second reading of the
Air Navigation Bill. An important part of the Bill relates to trespass
or nuisance by aeroplanes. The rights of the property-owner <i>usque ad
c&oelig;lum</i> will obviously have to be considerably modified if commercial
aviation is to be possible; but Lord <span class="sc">Montagu</span> entered a <i>caveat</i> against
accepting the provisions of the Bill in this regard without close
examination. Constant flying over a man&#8217;s house or property might, as he
said, constitute a serious nuisance. Imagine an &ldquo;air-drummer,&rdquo; if one
may so call him, hovering over a Royal garden-party and showering down
leaflets on the distinguished guests.</p>

<p>The little <i>coterie</i> that is so nervously anxious lest this country
should do anything to assist the Poles in their attacks on the
Bolshevists was particularly active this afternoon. Even the <span class="sc">Speaker&#8217;s</span>
large tolerance is beginning to give out. One of the gang announced his
intention of repeating a question already answered. &ldquo;And I give notice,&rdquo;
said Mr. <span class="sc">Lowther</span>, &ldquo;that if the hon. and gallant Member does repeat it I
shall not allow it to appear on the Notice-paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another hon. Member wanted to know why, if we were not helping the
Poles, we kept a British mission at Warsaw. &ldquo;Among other things,&rdquo;
replied Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>, &ldquo;to enable me to answer questions put to me
here.&rdquo; A third sought information regarding the expenditure of the
Secret Service money, and was duly snubbed by Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> with the
reply that if he answered the question the Service would cease to be
secret.</p>

<p>The rejection of the Finance Bill was moved by Mr. <span class="sc">Bottomley</span>. In his
view the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> was making a great mistake in trying to pay off
debt, especially if it meant the taxation of such harmless luxuries as
champagne and cigars. &ldquo;Let posterity pay,&rdquo; was his motto. Still, if Mr.
<span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> was determined to persist in his foolish course, let him
give him (Mr. <span class="sc">Bottomley</span>) a free hand and he would guarantee to raise a
thousand millions in a month. The best comment on this oration was
furnished by Mr. <span class="sc">Barnes</span>, who strongly advocated a tax upon
advertisements.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 12th.</i>&mdash;The prevalent notion that the only road a
Scotsman cares about is that which leads to England cannot be maintained
in face of Lord <span class="sc">Balfour&#8217;s</span> vigorous indictment of the Ministry of
Transport for its neglect of the highways in his native Clackmannan. The
Duke of <span class="sc">Sutherland</span> was equally eloquent about the deplorable state of
the Highlands, where the people were not even allowed telephones to make
up for their lack of transport facilities. &ldquo;Evil communications corrupt
good manners,&rdquo; and there was real danger that the Highlanders would vote
&ldquo;Wee Free&rdquo; at the next General Election. Appalled by this prospect, no
doubt, Lord <span class="sc">Lytton</span> hastened to return a soft answer, from which we
learned that three-quarters of a million had already been allocated to
Scottish roads, and gathered that the dearest ambition of Sir <span class="sc">Eric
Geddes</span> was to share the fame of the hero immortalised in the famous

<p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Sir Robert Horne welcomes a useful ally.</span></p></div>

<p>Only Mr. <span class="sc">Kipling</span> could do full justice to the story of the abduction,
pursuit and recapture&mdash;all within thirty-six hours&mdash;of an English lady
at Peshawar. Even as officially narrated by Mr. <span class="sc">Montagu</span> it was
sufficiently exciting. The most curious and reassuring fact was that all
the actors in the drama, abductors and rescuers alike, were Afridis. It
is to be hoped that this versatile community includes a cinematograph
operator, and that a film will, like the lady, shortly be &ldquo;released.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The miners&#8217; representatives made an unselfish protest against the
increase in the price of coal. Although it would justify them in
demanding a further increase in their present inadequate wage they did
not believe it was necessary or, at any rate, urgent. Sir <span class="sc">Robert Horne</span>
assured them that it was, and that the present moment&mdash;the season in
happier days of &ldquo;Lowest Summer Prices&rdquo;&mdash;had been selected as the least
inconvenient to the public.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, May 13th.</i>&mdash;Ireland maintains its pre-eminence as the land of
paradox. Among the hunger-strikers recently released from Mountjoy
prison were (by an accident) several men who had actually been
convicted. The House learned to its surprise that these men cannot be
re-arrested, but are out for good (their own, though possibly not the
community&#8217;s); whereas the untried (and possibly innocent) suspects may
be re-arrested at any moment.</p>

<p>The new Profiteering Bill, which, to judge by the criticisms levelled
against its exceptions and safeguards, will be about as effective as its
predecessor, was read a third time. So was the Health Insurance Bill,
but not until a few Independent Liberals, led by Captain <span class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</span>,
had been rebuked for their obstructive tactics by Mr. <span class="sc">Myers</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Neil
Maclean</span> of the Labour Party. As the small hours grew larger this split
in the Progressive ranks developed into a yawning chasm, and the
Government got a third Bill passed before the weary House adjourned at
six o&#8217;clock.</p>

<h2>A SMALL FARM.</h2>

<p>To all of you who have begun to gaze pensively at railway posters, to
furrow your brows over maps and guide-books, or hover sheepishly about
the inquiry offices of Holiday Touring Agencies, I would whisper: &ldquo;Go to
a small farm and bask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You will note that I say a <i>small</i> farm. A large farm has much that is
pleasant and pungent about it, but to my mind you cannot bask properly
on a large farm. You are too much in the way. The medley of barns,
byres, styes, rods, poles and perches is a hive of restless energy.
Unless you are walking about with a bucket or prodding something with a
stick you feel you have no right to be there. On a large farm you are
expected to accompany your host across a couple of ten-acre fields to
look at his young wheat. Some people can tell what is the matter with a
field of young wheat by merely leaning on a gate and glancing at it.
Unless I can feel its pulse or take its temperature I cannot tell
whether young wheat is suffering from whooping-cough or nasal catarrh.
All I can do is to nod my head sagely and say that, considering the sort
of Government we have got, it looks pretty flourishing. Then my host
remarks that he has got a young bull in Bodger&#8217;s Paddock (about three
miles across country) that it will do my heart good to see. That is the
worst of a large farm; anything you want is sure to be several fields
away from you.</p>

<p>Now at the small farm which I recommend, but the address of which I am
not going to give away, you may lie and bask by the duck pond and be
quite in the picture. Further, if a sudden irresistible desire for
something&mdash;a hoe or a cow, for example&mdash;should come over you, you have
only to put out your hand and grab it. There is a compactness about the
place. They do not put the cattle in odd fields five miles apart, but
leave them to lounge round the duck pond or sit in the front garden,
where they can be collected without effort. There are no energetic
squads of farm-labourers; no bustling battalions of land-girls with
motor-plough attachments. The outdoor staff is generally to be found
sitting on a bucket by the duck pond rubbing at a bit of harness and
looking decently rural. When he has rubbed the harness he stands up and
looks at the young wheat. Then he turns round and glances at the
mangel-wurzel field. If the appearance of it displeases him he reaches
out for a rake and puts it right. Then he sits on the bucket again and
has lunch.</p>

<p>When you go to bed at this farm you knock your head against the lintel
of the sitting-room with a force corresponding to your height and
vitality. Then you hit your head a second time when ascending the stairs
and again on entering the bedroom. If you are a heavy breather you sweep
the ceiling clear of flies and cobwebs while you sleep. At dawn, or
possibly an hour or so before (for he is a nervously conscientious
bird), the farm cock steps off the roof of the cow-shed on to your
window-sill and bursts into enthusiastic admiration of himself and
things in general. Some people of an egoistic and unimaginative
temperament get up at once, in order that they may spend the rest of the
day telling you how much they enjoyed the sunrise and what a fool you
were to miss it. The true basker, on the other hand, declines to be a
party to a procedure which destroys the whole poetry of dawn and reduces
the proud chanticleer to the sordid status of an alarum-clock. He simply
pushes the bird off the window-sill with his foot, turns over and goes
to sleep. And later on, when the sound of other people knocking their
heads against various portions of the building arouses him, he goes to
sleep again.</p>

<h2>BRIDGING THE LITERARY GULF.</h2>

<p>(<i>Famous Publisher&#8217;s Great Scheme of Reconciliation.</i>)</p>

<p>Hearing on good authority that Mr. Blinkingham, the well-known
publisher, was about to launch an enterprise of a magnitude only
comparable with that of the <i>Ency. Brit.</i> or the <i>D.N.B.</i>, Mr. Punch
hastened to headquarters for confirmation of the report, was graciously
admitted to his presence and furnished with the following interesting
details. Mr. Blinkingham, it may be mentioned, is at all points a finely
equipped representative of his class, handsome, well-groomed and wearing
his monocle with distinction. His sanctum is furnished with delightfully
catholic taste&mdash;Louis Quinze furniture, a Japanese embossed wall-paper,
pictures by <span class="sc">Botticelli</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Wyndham Lewis</span> and statuettes of <span class="sc">Plato</span>,
<span class="sc">Voltaire</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span> (the Historian, not the Bombardier).</p>

<p>After some preliminary observations on the deplorable condition of the
pulp industry, Mr. Blinkingham unfolded his colossal scheme. &ldquo;By way of
preface,&rdquo; remarked the great literary <i>impresario</i>, &ldquo;let me call your
attention to the momentous statement made by the Editor of <i>The
Athenæum</i> in the issue of May 7th: &lsquo;We doubt whether there has ever been
a generation of men of letters so startlingly uneducated as this, so
little interested in the study of the great writers before them.&rsquo; The
Editor of <i>The Athenæum</i> takes a most gloomy view of the situation,
which is fraught with an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion inimical
to a revival of criticism. Yet he sees in such a revival the only way of
salvation, the only means of healing the internecine feud which is now
convulsing the young literary world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my own part I am convinced that a better way is to lure back the
modernists to a study of great writers by presenting them in a more
palatable form, not by compressing or abridging them&mdash;for that has been
tried before&mdash;but by having them re-written in conformity with
present-day standards by eminent contemporary writers. This notion had
been germinating in my head for some time past, but I did not see my way
clear until I read the luminous and epoch-making remark of Mr. <span class="sc">C. K.
Shorter</span>, that he would sooner have written <i>Tom Jones</i> than any book
published these two hundred years. In a moment, in a flash, my scheme
took shape. &lsquo;He shall write it, or rather re-write it,&rsquo; I said to
myself, and I have already submitted to this eminent man of letters my
rough <i>scenario</i> of the lines on which <span class="sc">Fielding&#8217;s</span> novel should be
brought home to the Georgian mind. In reply he has made a
counter-suggestion that the characters should be rearranged on a
Victorian basis, <span class="sc">Charlotte Brontë</span> replacing <i>Sophia</i>, <span class="sc">Thackeray</span> <i>Mr.
Allworthy</i>, while the title-rôle should be assigned to an enterprising
publisher. But I am not without hope that he will adopt my plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The revival of interest in the works of <span class="sc">Richardson</span>, the other great
eighteenth-century novelist, is, I think I may safely say, a foregone
conclusion. Miss <span class="sc">Dorothy Richardson</span> has enthusiastically welcomed the
proposition that she should reconstruct the romances of her illustrious
namesake, and confidently expects, on the basis of the method employed
by her in <i>The Tunnel</i>, that she will be able to excavate at least a
hundred volumes from the materials supplied in <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>
and <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor shall we overlook the earlier masters. Professor <span class="sc">Chamberlin</span>, whose
thrilling lectures on <span class="sc">Queen Elizabeth</span> and Lord <span class="sc">Leicester</span> have been the
talk of the town for the last fortnight, has kindly undertaken to
organise a new <i>variorum</i> version of the Plays of <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>, with the
assistance of Mr. <span class="sc">Looney</span>, the writer of the recently-published and final
work on the authorship of the plays. <span class="sc">Milton</span> will be presented in both
verse and prose, Mr. <span class="sc">Masefield</span> having promised to re-write his epic in
six-lined rhymed stanzas, shorn of Latinisms; while a famous novelist,
who does not wish her name to appear at present, has consented to recast
it in the form of a romance under the title of <i>The Miseries of
Mephistopheles</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Returning to the eighteenth century, I am glad to be able to say that a
brilliant reconstruction of <span class="sc">Pope&#8217;s</span> <i>Dunciad</i> is promised by the <span class="sc">Sitwell</span>
family, in which the milk-and-water school is held up to ridicule, with
<span class="sc">Tennyson</span> in the place of dishonour formerly occupied by <span class="sc">Theobald</span>. With a
magnanimity that cannot be too highly commended, the staff of <i>The
Times</i> has undertaken to adapt another forgotten work under the title of
<i>Grey&#8217;s Eulogy</i>, with special reference to the work of the League of
Nations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess to feeling rather doubtful as to the possibility of reviving
any interest in the works of <span class="sc">Scott</span>, <span class="sc">Dickens</span> and <span class="sc">Thackeray</span>. They are at
once too near and too far. Still I hope to persuade Miss <span class="sc">Rebecca West</span> to
try her hand at <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Then there is <span class="sc">George Eliot</span>, another
uncertain quantity, though perhaps something might be made of <i>The Mill
on the Floss</i> if it were renamed <i>Tulliver&#8217;s Travels</i>, and given an
up-to-date industrial atmosphere by Mr. <span class="sc">Arnold Bennett</span>. I have my eye on
Mr. <span class="sc">Lytton Strachey</span> as the man who could make a fine modern version of
<i>Tom Brown&#8217;s Schooldays</i>. At the moment he is too busy with his <i>Life of
Queen <span class="sc">Victoria</span></i>, but I feel sure he will not lightly abandon so splendid
an opportunity of unmasking the pedantry and pietism of Dr. <span class="sc">Arnold</span> and
throwing the white light of truth on &lsquo;Rugby Chapel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<h4>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Why Marry?</span>&rdquo;</h4>

<p>This is a protracted discussion of a venerable topic and takes place in
a sun-parlour, which I regret to say is the brightest thing about it.</p>

<p><i>John</i> is a dollar-snob&mdash;it is <i>John&#8217;s</i> parlour&mdash;and has two sisters,
<i>Jean</i> and <i>Helen</i>. <i>John</i> is easily the heavy-weight champion in stage
brothers. Sister <i>Jean</i>, who is entirely dependent on <i>John</i>, loves a
poor man, but under <i>John&#8217;s</i> guidance traps a rich one. Sister <i>Helen</i>
(who has a job) also loves a poor man, but thinks marriage not good
enough. This was, I imagine, due chiefly to living with <i>John</i> and <i>Mrs.
John</i>. She may have got a touch of the sun-parlour. Her man is a
terrific young scientist, who once with four colleagues deliberately let
a dangerous Cuban mosquito nibble his arm. The colleagues died while
<i>Ernest</i> survived, which I regretted. However he became demonstrator at
the Institute of Bacteriology, with <i>Helen</i> as his assistant, and in the
excitement of the imminent discovery of his new bacillus the two spend
the night in the laboratory totally unchaperoned. The discovery saved
thousands of American babes, but it ruined <i>Helen&#8217;s</i> reputation.</p>

<p>Here the narrative becomes confused, but anyhow <i>John</i>, who was a
trustee of the Institute, spent the three Acts in alternately sacking
and reinstating <i>Helen</i> and <i>Ernest</i>, in thinking of a salary, doubling
it, adding thousands of dollars to it and taking away the salary first
thought of, together with the additions (and so <i>da capo</i>), according as
he wished to prevent the marriage because of <i>Ernest&#8217;s</i> poverty, or
bring it off because of <i>Ernest&#8217;s</i> disposition to take <i>Helen</i> to Paris
(France) and dispense with empty rites, or postpone it to gain time, or,
on the contrary, have it celebrated between the dressing and the dinner
gongs in order to announce it to important members of the family, who,
if I understood the butler aright, had already fallen on their food
while host and hostess, two pairs of lovers, Uncle <i>Everett</i> and Cousin
<i>John</i> were bickering in the sun-parlour.</p>

<p>Cousin <i>Theodore</i>, a guileless and dollarless clergyman, padded about on
the outskirts of the discussion, making obvious remarks about the
sanctity of marriage and enunciating the highest principles, which he
promptly swallowed. But it was Uncle <i>Everett</i>, the judge (the only
human figure in the bunch), who grasped the fact (long after I did, but
let that pass) that the two principal young egotists simply loved being
talked over at such gross length. To put an end to the business he used
a trick whereby, apparently according to the law of the unnamed State in
which the parlour was situate, the two were legally married without
intending it. They had the tact to accept this solution, and this
softened my heart towards them for the first time.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see Mr. <span class="sc">Aubrey Smith</span> wondering how on earth he had got
into this play, and Mr. <span class="sc">A. E. George</span> prowling about the stage intent
apparently on showing how many ways there are of uttering &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Tut-tut!&rdquo; or noise to that effect. It isn&#8217;t as easy as it ought to be
to do justice to players playing impossible parts; to Miss <span class="sc">Henrietta
Watson</span> struggling pluckily and skilfully with her <i>Mrs. John</i>; or to Mr.
<span class="sc">Cowley Wright</span> or Miss <span class="sc">Rosa Lynd</span>, so perfectly appalling did <i>Ernest</i> and
<i>Helen</i> seem to me and so anxious was I to get them off to Paris
respectably or otherwise. They never, by the way, gave me the faintest
impression that they could ever have done work of any value in their
laboratory.</p>

<p>I have no idea what the moral of this modern mystery play may be, but I
did gather that the authoress was seriously perplexed, not perhaps in
any startlingly new way, about the difficulties of marriage and the
conventional hypocrisies that hedge round that honourable institution,
but just forgot that serious argument cannot easily be conveyed through
the medium of fantastically impossible and uninteresting people in an
extravagantly farcical situation. The play was kindly received.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch&#8217;s Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>I should certainly call Mr. <span class="sc">Compton Mackenzie</span> our first living expositor
of London in fiction. Indeed the precision with which, from his Italian
home, he can recapture the aspect and atmosphere of London
neighbourhoods is itself an astonishing feat. In <i>The Vanity Girl</i>
(<span class="sc">Cassell</span>) he has happily abandoned the rather breathless manner induced
by the migratious <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i>, and returns to the West Kensington
of <i>Sinister Street</i>, blended subsequently with that theatrical Bohemia
in which <i>Jenny Pearl</i> danced her little tragedy. There is something
(though by no means all) of the interest of <i>Carnival</i> in the new stage
story; that the adventures of <i>Dorothy</i> lack the compelling charm of her
predecessor is inevitable from the difference in temperament of the two
heroines and the fact that Mr. <span class="sc">Mackenzie</span> with all his art has been
unable to rouse more than dispassionate interest in what is really a
study of successful egotism. From the moment when, in the first chapter,
we encounter <i>Dorothy</i> (whose real name was <i>Norah</i>) washing her hair at
a window in Lonsdale Road, an eligible <i>cul-de-sac</i> ending in a railway
line, beyond which a high rampart marked the reverse of the Earl&#8217;s Court
Exhibition panorama, to that final page on which we take leave of her as
a widowed countess, sacrificing her future for the sake of an Earl&#8217;s
Court of a different <i>genre</i>, her career, sentimental, financial and
matrimonial, is told with amazing vivacity but a rather conspicuous lack
of emotional appeal. It is perhaps an unequal book; in parts as good as
the author&#8217;s best, in others hurried and perfunctory. One of our more
superior Reviews was lately debating Mr. <span class="sc">Mackenzie&#8217;s</span> command of the
&ldquo;memorable phrase.&rdquo; There are a score here that I should delight to
quote, even if the setting is not always entirely worthy of them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>So long as &ldquo;<span class="sc">Berta Ruck</span>&rdquo; will write for us such pretty books as
<i>Sweethearts Unmet</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>), we need never feel ourselves
dependent on America for our supply of sugary novels. This home-grown
variety is just as sweet, and really, I think, may be guaranteed not
only harmless but positively beneficial. The authoress has evidently a
tender pity for the young men and women whom our social conditions doom
either to have no companions among their contemporaries or only the
wrong ones. Her heroine represents the too-much-sheltered girl alone in
an elderly circle, her hero the lonely young man who has no means of
getting to know people of his own sort (I can&#8217;t say class, because the
authoress seems rather uncertain about that herself). Her story is
written in alternate instalments by &ldquo;the boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;the girl,&rdquo; a method
which encourages intimacy in the telling as well as a sort of gushing
attention to the reader not so pleasant. Miss <span class="sc">Nora Schlegel</span> has drawn a
pretty picture of <i>Julia</i> and <i>Jack</i> to adorn the wrapper, and I can
assure everyone who cares to know it that they are just as nice as they
look; <i>Jack&#8217;s</i> passion for abbreviation (&ldquo;rhodos&rdquo; for rhododendrons)
being the only ground of quarrel I have with them or their creator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span></p>

<p>In <i>Passion</i> (<span class="sc">Duckworth</span>) Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw Desmond</span> desperately wants to say
something terrific about love, money and power. His violence makes one
feel that one is reading under a shower of brickbats, and it is the
effort of dodging these which perhaps distracts the mind from his
message. (Is he a Marinettist, I wonder?) There are not enough words in
the language for him, so he invents fresh ones at will; while as for
grammar and syntax he passionately throttled them in Chapter I.; nor did
they recover. I will own that notwithstanding all this the author has a
way of making you read on to find out what it is all about. You don&#8217;t
find out; but there, life&#8217;s like that, isn&#8217;t it? The author&#8217;s ideas of
the operations of high finance are ingenuous. The <i>Mandrill</i> (do I
rightly guess this to be a portrait distorted from the life?), who is
out to corner copper and &ldquo;do down&rdquo; the <i>Squid</i> (head of the opposing
copper group), is, if you are to judge by his passionate exuberance at
board meetings, about as likely to corner the green cheese in the moon.
I imagine the author saying, &ldquo;<i>Mandrills</i> mayn&#8217;t be like that, but
that&#8217;s how I see &#8217;em. It&#8217;s my vision and mood that matter. Take it or
leave it.&rdquo; Well, on the whole I should advise you to take it, first
putting on a sort of mental tin hat. You&#8217;ll at least have gathered that
Mr. <span class="sc">Desmond</span> is a lively writer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Of a war-story reviewed in these pages some months ago I remember taking
occasion to say that the author had damaged his effect by a too obvious
wish to injure the reputation of a certain cavalry brigade (or words to
that effect). Well, a book that I have just been reading, <i>The
Squadroon</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>), might in some sense be regarded as a counterblast to
the former volume, since its writer, Major <span class="sc">Ardern Beaman</span>, D.S.O., has
admittedly intended it as a vindication of the work of the cavalry in
the Great War. I can say at once that the defence could scarcely have
found a better advocate. Major <span class="sc">Beaman</span> (who, I think superfluously,
figures in his own pages in the fictional character of Padre) has
written one of the most interesting records that I have read of personal
experience on the Western Front. Partly this is explained by his
fortunate possession of a style at once sincere, sanely balanced and
always engaging. Also his story, apart from the matter of it, reveals in
the men of whom he writes (and incidentally in the writer himself) a
combination of just those qualities that we like to call essentially
British. Cavalrymen of course will read it with a special fervour; but I
am mistaken if its genial temper does not disarm even so difficult a
critic as the ex-infantry Lieutenant&mdash;than which I could hardly say
more. In short, <i>The Squadroon</i> is a belated war book in which the most
weary of such matters may well recapture their interest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Written in the last great ebb and flow of the War, when the censorship
still prevented anything like carping criticism of matters near the
battle-front, <i>The Glory of the Coming</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>) naturally
resolves itself into a pæan of praise of the French and British armies
in general and the American troops in particular, both white and black.
Mr. <span class="sc">Irvin S. Cobb</span> brings good credentials to his task, for he saw the
advance of the German army through Belgium in 1914, and in this book he
describes the combined resistance to their last great effort before
defeat. The accident, if we may so call it, to the Fifth Army has had
nowhere a more eloquent apologist. &ldquo;They were like ants; they were like
flies,&rdquo; he says of the Germans; &ldquo;they left their dead lying so thickly
behind that finally the ground seemed as though it were covered with a
grey carpet.&rdquo; There are interesting strictures in the later chapters on
some of the quaint semi-official delegations and personages who
persuaded the United States Government to let them come over and visit
the War; and there are a number of quite good yarns of the Yankee
private, related in the Yankee style. But better than all the American
stories I think I like that of the Bedfordshire soldier who, when asked
by the writer to direct him to Blérincourt during the chaos of the great
retreat, replied, &ldquo;I am rather a stranger in these parts myself.&rdquo;
Perhaps by the way I ought to make it quite clear that the title refers
to the coming of the American troops, and that, although the line, &ldquo;He
is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored,&rdquo; is
also quoted in the prefatory stanza, there is nothing in the book about
Mr. <span class="sc">&ldquo;Pussyfoot&rdquo; Johnson</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I suppose the War did throw up a great number of worthy pomposities
genuinely eager to serve their country in some conspicuous and applauded
way, and old <i>Mr. Thompson</i>, the principal figure in <i>Young Hearts</i>
(<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>), may be taken, on the authority of <span class="sc">J. E.
Buckrose</span>, as an East Riding variant of the type. He had always some
patent scheme for winning the War or improving the Peace, and no doubt
deserved all the ragging he got, though I lost my zest in the matter
before the author did. <i>Mr. Thompson</i> had two daughters: a minx (almost
too minx-like for belief) and a never-told-her-love maiden of sterling
worth. The latter marries the good-young-man-under-a-cloud (the cloud
was, of course, a misapprehension or, alternatively, had a silver
lining), though the minx shamelessly tried to &ldquo;bag him,&rdquo; as she did
every eligible male, the good sister tamely submitting under the
impression apparently that the other was a perfect darling. I indeed
seemed to be the only person who really understood what a little beast
she was&mdash;and possibly the author, who finally allotted to her the
beautiful unsatisfactory young man with the emotional tenor. Commended
for easy seaside reading.</p>
